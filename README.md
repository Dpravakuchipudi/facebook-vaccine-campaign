#  Facebook Vaccine Ad Campaign Simulation

This repository presents a comprehensive pipeline for a **simulated field experiment** evaluating the behavioral impact of Facebook ad campaigns on COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The workflow mimics a real-world randomized controlled trial (RCT) and includes:

- Sophisticated **data simulation** of 5,000 participants across the U.S.
- A modular, end-to-end **experimental design workflow**
- Robust **causal inference** techniques including ITT and TOT analyses
- Measurement of **attitude shifts** before and after ad exposure
- Optional **network-based modeling** to explore community-level dynamics and peer influence

---

## üéØ Objective

This task involves simulating a randomized field experiment designed to evaluate the effectiveness of two Facebook ad strategies‚Äîone appealing to **reason**, the other to **emotion**‚Äîin increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake across a sample of 5,000 individuals in the United States.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:
- A **reason-based ad group**
- An **emotion-based ad group**
- A **control group** that received no ad

All participants completed a **baseline survey**, and 4,500 completed an **endline survey** after the ad exposure phase. The aim of the task is to generate realistic synthetic data, conduct statistical and causal analysis (including ITT and TOT), and report on the effectiveness of the campaigns using well-structured visualizations and code.

## üß™ Experimental Design

The task simulates a randomized controlled trial with the following setup:

- **Participants:** 5,000 individuals distributed across the U.S.
- **Group Assignment:**
  - 1/3 assigned to receive a **reason-based Facebook ad**
  - 1/3 assigned to receive an **emotion-based Facebook ad**
  - 1/3 assigned to a **control group** (no ad exposure)
- **Survey Participation:**
  - All participants complete a **baseline survey** capturing demographics, vaccine attitudes, trust in science/government, and engagement levels
  - A follow-up **endline survey** is completed by 4,500 participants (simulating real-world drop-off)
- **Reach Simulation:** Not all assigned participants are assumed to have seen the ad. Exposure probabilities are:
  - `Ad_Emotion`: 70%
  - `Ad_Reason`: 65%
  - `Control`: 0% (by design)

This design mirrors experimental protocols used in behavioral and public health research, allowing for meaningful comparisons using ITT and TOT frameworks.

##  Analytical Methods

This task incorporates both descriptive and inferential techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the Facebook ad strategies. The analysis is structured into three key components:

---

### 1. Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

- **Vaccine uptake** rates calculated across the three groups
![Vaccine Uptake by Ad Group](outputs/vaccine_uptake_by_ad_group.png)
*Figure: Vaccine uptake across ad conditions (Reason, Emotion, Control).*
- **Pre- and post-attitude scores** analyzed to measure shifts in perception
- **Chi-square test** performed to determine whether differences in uptake are statistically significant across groups
- **T-test** conducted to assess whether participants with higher social connectivity (centrality) were more likely to vaccinate

---

### 2. Causal Modeling

- **Intention-to-Treat (ITT)** analysis: Estimates the impact of group assignment, regardless of exposure
- **Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT)** analysis: Restricts analysis to only those exposed to the ad
- **Logistic regression** used to model the likelihood of vaccine uptake based on:
  - Assigned ad group
  - Vaccine hesitancy score
  - Trust in science

---

### 3. Network-Based Analysis (Optional Enhancement)

- **Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi social network** simulated across participants
- **Degree centrality** computed to model influence
- **Greedy modularity-based community detection** identifies clusters of participants
- **Community-level uptake** variation analyzed to explore social reinforcement effects

---

All analyses are accompanied by clear **tables, visualizations**, and **statistical outputs**, saved automatically in the `outputs/` directory.

### Summary of Key Findings


![Summary Visuals](outputs/summary_visuals_combined.png)

Vaccination Rates by Ad Type

Emotion-based ads resulted in the highest vaccine uptake (~65%), followed by reason-based ads (~60%) and the control group (~50%).

‚û§ Emotionally driven messaging was the most persuasive in encouraging vaccinations.

Vaccine Uptake Across Hesitancy Levels

The emotion group maintained higher uptake across all hesitancy scores.

‚û§ Even hesitant individuals responded better to emotional appeals.

Trust in Science vs Vaccine Uptake

People who got vaccinated showed slightly higher average trust in science, but the overlap was notable.

‚û§ Trust plays a role, but alone doesn't explain vaccine behavior ‚Äî messaging remains key.

Political Affiliation and Uptake

All political groups (liberal, moderate, conservative) showed similar vaccination rates when exposed to ads.

‚û§ Ad impact was consistent across political identities, showing broad effectiveness.



![Uptake by Group](outputs/vaccine_uptake_by_ad_group.png) ![Attitude Change](outputs/attitude_change_by_group.png)

Campaign Effectiveness : 
Ad_Emotion was the most effective strategy:
1. 65.3% uptake rate
2. Showed the highest average increase in attitude towards vaccination.

Ad_Reason also outperformed the control group:
1. 59.8% uptake rate
2. Moderate attitude improvement.

Control group had the lowest uptake at 49.9% and a slight negative shift in attitude.



![Logistic Model](outputs/logistic_summary.txt) ![ITT vs TOT](outputs/itt_vs_tot_comparison.png)

A Chi-square test confirmed that differences in uptake between groups are statistically significant (œá¬≤ = 73.37, p < 0.001).

A logistic regression showed:

Belonging to the Control or Ad_Reason group decreased the odds of vaccination relative to the Ad_Emotion group.

Vaccine hesitancy had a small positive coefficient, indicating those more hesitant may still be persuaded.

Trust in science was not a significant predictor in the model.


[Attitude Change](outputs/attitude_change_by_group.png)

Participants exposed to emotion-based messaging showed the greatest positive shift in attitude scores (mean change ‚âà +0.55).

Control group participants slightly regressed.


![Centrality vs Uptake](outputs/network_centrality_vs_uptake.png)  ![Community Histogram](outputs/vaccine_uptake_by_community.png)  

Participants with higher degree centrality in the simulated network were significantly more likely to be vaccinated (t = 2.00, p = 0.045).

Uptake varied by community, highlighting the non-random clustering effects in behavior adoption.



![Trust Boxplot](outputs/trust_vs_uptake_boxplot.png)   ![Political Uptake](outputs/uptake_by_political_affiliation.png)

People with higher trust in science had slightly higher uptake, but this was not significant in regression.

Liberals and Moderates were more likely to vaccinate than Conservatives.
