# Facebook Vaccine Ad Campaign Simulation

This repository presents a complete pipeline for a **simulated field experiment** examining the impact of different Facebook ad campaigns on COVID-19 vaccine uptake. It includes:

- End-to-end **data simulation**
- A full **experimental design workflow**
- **Causal inference** using intention-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-the-treated (TOT)
- **Attitude shift analysis**
- **Network-based modeling** and community-level behavioral insights

---

##  Objective

To simulate a realistic public health experiment and evaluate the **effectiveness of behavior-change messaging** delivered through social media ads ‚Äî comparing appeals to **reason** vs **emotion** ‚Äî in increasing vaccine adoption.

This experiment mirrors the logic and methodology used in academic and policy research and is especially inspired by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used in **development economics, public health, and behavioral science**.

---

##  Summary of Experimental Design

- **Participants:** 5,000 individuals
- **Random Assignment:**
  - 1/3 receive a **reason-based** ad
  - 1/3 receive an **emotion-based** ad
  - 1/3 are **control group**
- **Surveys:** All complete a **baseline survey**, and 4,500 complete an **endline survey**
- **Reach simulation:** Only ~65‚Äì70% in treatment groups are assumed to be exposed to the ad

---

##  Analytical Methods

###  Descriptive & Inferential Stats:
- Vaccine uptake % by ad group
- Attitude change (pre vs post)
- Chi-square test for group differences
- T-test on network centrality

### Causal Modeling:
- **ITT vs TOT** estimation
- **Logistic regression** on uptake using:
  - Ad group
  - Trust in science
  - Vaccine hesitancy

### Network Science (Optional Enhancements):
- Randomly generated social network (Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model)
- Community detection via **modularity optimization**
- Centrality vs uptake correlation
- Community-level uptake variance

##  How to Run This Pipeline

Each step is modular and can be executed independently:

```bash
# STEP 1: Simulate baseline survey
python scripts/01_baseline_only.py

# STEP 2: Randomly assign ad groups
python scripts/02_assign_groups.py

# STEP 3: Simulate endline responses
python scripts/03_simulate_endline.py

# STEP 4: Analyze ITT, TOT, regression, visualizations
python scripts/04_analyze_effectiveness.py

# STEP 5: Optional ‚Äî Centrality and uptake boxplot
python scripts/05_network_analysis.py

# STEP 6: Optional ‚Äî Community structure, t-test, subgraph visuals
python scripts/06_network_deepdive.py
```

##  Interpretation Highlights

- **Ad_Emotion group** had the highest vaccine uptake and greatest attitude improvement
- **Statistically significant** differences in uptake were observed (Chi2 test)
- **Central participants** (in simulated network) were more likely to vaccinate
- **Community-level clustering** revealed uptake varies across subgroups even in randomized contexts
